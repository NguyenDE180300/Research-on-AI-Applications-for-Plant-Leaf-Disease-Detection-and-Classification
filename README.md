## üìù Introduction

This is a research and development project focused on building an Artificial Intelligence model to detect and classify plant leaf diseases. The project is developed by **Ho√†ng Trung Nguy√™n** and team **Skin Issue** from **FPT University**, aimed at participating in the **Resconn 2025 Da Nang** competition.

The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Machine Learning and Transformer-based architectures to classify plant leaf images into 18 different categories, including various common diseases and healthy leaves.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises four distinct plant species, encompassing 14 disease categories, each paired with a corresponding textual description. To ensure data consistency and reduce intra-class variability, images were captured at a standardized distance. Descriptive information about the disease symptoms was carefully compiled from authoritative sources such as the University of Minnesota Extension (UME), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and peer-reviewed literature, resulting in high-quality annotations that facilitate advanced research in AI-based plant disease diagnosis.
