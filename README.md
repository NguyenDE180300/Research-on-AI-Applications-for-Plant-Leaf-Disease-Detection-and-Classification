## Introduction

This is a research and development project focused on building an Artificial Intelligence model to detect and classify plant leaf diseases. The project is developed by **Hoàng Trung Nguyên** and team **Skin Issue** from **FPT University**, aimed at participating in the **Resconn 2025 Da Nang** competition.

The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Machine Learning and Transformer-based architectures to classify plant leaf images into 18 different categories, including various common diseases and healthy leaves.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises four distinct plant species, encompassing 14 disease categories, each paired with a corresponding textual description. To ensure data consistency and reduce intra-class variability, images were captured at a standardized distance. Descriptive information about the disease symptoms was carefully compiled from authoritative sources such as the University of Minnesota Extension (UME), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and peer-reviewed literature, resulting in high-quality annotations that facilitate advanced research in AI-based plant disease diagnosis.

## Methodology and Results
Due to the considerable class imbalance evident in our dataset, as illustrated in Figure 2, depending exclusively on overall Accuracy as the principal evaluation metric may be deceptive. Accuracy is sometimes influenced by the model's efficacy on majority classes, perhaps obscuring inadequate performance on minority classes, which frequently signify infrequent but vital disease occurrences. Consequently, we prioritize the F1-score as the principal performance metric. The F1-score, as the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall, offers a more equitable assessment of the model's proficiency in accurately classifying both positive (diseased) and negative (healthy) occurrences, especially when there is an imbalanced distribution of classes. In addition to the F1-score, metrics such as Precision, Recall, and total Accuracy are also presented to provide a thorough performance evaluation.
All experiments were performed on a specialized workstation including an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 GPU, which supplied the requisite processing capacity for training intricate deep learning models. The system was additionally equipped with an AMD Ryzen 7 5700X 8 Core CPU and 32GB of DDR4 RAM. The deep learning models were executed using Python 3.10.18 and the PyTorch 2.5.1 framework, and the CUDA 12.1 library for GPU acceleration. This hardware and software combination enabled the rapid training and evaluation of all proposed models within an acceptable time frame.
